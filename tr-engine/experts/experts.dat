ron weiss associate professor department of biological engineering department of electrical engineering and computer science ph d 2001 massachusetts institute of technology my research focuses on programming new cellular behaviors by designing and embedding synthetic gene networks that perform desired functions in single cells and multi cellular environments we genetically engineer a variety of cell types including bacteria yeast and mammalian stem cells this nascent field of synthetic biology holds promise for a wide range of applications such as programmed tissue engineering environmental biosensing and effecting biomaterial fabrication and an improved understanding of naturally occuring biological processes the construction of de novo genetic circuits begins with the assembly and characterization of genetic parts or building blocks we have assembled a library of genetic components that regulate transcription translation phosphorylation and synthesis of and response to signaling molecules such as acyl homoserine lactones in bacteria and cytokinins in eukaryotes we then combine these parts into various network topologies that elicit new behaviors in a programmable fashion in single cells we have constructed transcriptional cascades and other network topologies with feedback and feed forward motifs we have shown theoretically and experimentally that these networks can perform digital computation attenuate gene expression noise or exhibit analog programmed functions such as pulse generation through the construction and analysis of such fundamental network motifs we aim to demonstrate sophisticated programmed control over gene expression as well as improve our quantitative understanding of naturally occurring complex gene networks another major emphasis is engineering synthetic multicellular systems through the integration of intracellular circuits with cell cell communication mechanisms e g lux and rhl quorum sensing systems beginning with simple sender receiver systems we have built a variety of more sophisticated multicellular interactions for coordinated cell behaviors one such system is the pulse generator where sender cells communicate to nearby receiver cells which then respond with a transient burst of gene expression whose amplitude and duration depends on the distance from the senders in another system receiver cells have been engineered to respond to cell cell communication signals from senders but only if the signal concentrations fall within prespecified ranges we demonstrated experimentally how a multicellular system that consists of several different detection thresholds can generate a variety of interesting spatial patterns shown in the figures below in a third system cells have been engineered to play conway s game of life where cells live or die based on the density of their neighbors this system exhibits complex global emergent behavior that arises from the interaction of cells based on simple local rules we are currently building a variety of other multicellular systems in bacteria that have interesting spatiotemporal dynamics finally we are also implementing synthetic gene networks and artificial cell cell communication in mammalian stem cells in order to control the spatiotemporal expression patterns of cell fate regulators with novel applications in programmed tissue engineering click here for a my lab s webpage click here for a list of my recentcontributions in synthetic biology click here for an older list of my publications my official biological engineering web page is here and myelectrical engineering and computer science web page is here contact info ne47 223 massachusetts institute of technology cambridge ma 02139 rweiss mit edu tel 617 253 8966

disparities in end of life care when discussing racial disparities in medical treatments critics often cite social factors as confounders which explain away any differences comparing the health of whites to that of non whites we do see that environmental and social factors conspire to yield higher rates of disease and shorter life spans in non white populations but does that really show that medical treatment itself is free from bias we examine end of life care in the icu stratified by ethnicity and controlled for acuity using severity assessment scores our analysis agrees with previous studies that nonwhites tend to receive more aggressive high risk high reward treatments such as mechanical ventilation than non whites despite receiving comparable or moderately less noninvasive treatments going further we show that using treatment patterns and clinical notes we are able to infer a patient s race finally we show evidence suggesting nonwhite have a much greater distrust of the medical community among than whites do we find that race even in the great equalizer of end of life care does continue to influence the treatments administered to a patient william boag peter

natural language processing i develop machine learning models that aim to understand and generate natural languages we are currently witnessing the first generation of nlp tools that have been deployed at scale and are used by millions of people however the major component of this success is access to large amounts of training data which machines use to learn mappings between input and output in many applications and languages such annotations are not readily available and are expensive and slow to collect i am interested in designing algorithms that do not suffer from this annotation dependence specifically we are developing deep learning models that can transfer annotations across domains and languages that can learn from a few annotated examples by utilizing supplementary data sources and that can take advantage of human provided rationales to constrain model structure oncology learning to cure data collected about millions of cancer patients their

csail mit edu phone 253 5874 room 32 32 g508 g514 gerald jay sussman is the panasonic formerly matsushita professor of electrical engineering at the massachusetts institute of technology he received the s b and the ph d degrees in mathematics from the massachusetts institute of technology in 1968 and 1973 respectively he has been involved in artificial intelligence research at m i t since 1964 his research has centered on understanding the problem solving strategies used by scientists and engineers with the goals of automating parts of the process and formalizing it to provide more effective methods of science and engineering education sussman has also worked in computer languages in computer architecture and in vlsi design sussman is a coauthor with hal abelson and julie sussman of the introductory computer science textbook used at m i t for 23 years the textbook structure and interpretation of computer programs has been translated into french german chinese polish japanese and korean as a result of this and other contributions to computer science education sussman received the acm s karl karlstrom outstanding educator award in 1990 and the amar g bose award for teaching in 1992 sussman s contributions to artificial intelligence include problem solving by debugging almost right plans propagation of constraints applied to electrical circuit analysis and synthesis dependency based explanation and dependency based backtracking and various language structures for expressing problem solving strategies sussman and his former student guy l steele jr invented the scheme programming language in 1975 sussman saw that artificial intelligence ideas can be applied to computer aided design sussman developed with his graduate students sophisticated computer aided design tools for vlsi steele made the first scheme chips in 1978 these ideas and the ai based cad technology to support them were further developed in the scheme chips of 1979 and 1981 the technique and experience developed was then used to design other special purpose computers sussman was the principal designer of the digital orrery a machine designed to do high precision integrations for orbital mechanics experiments the orrery was designed and built by a few people in a few months using ai based simulation and compilation tools using the digital orrery sussman worked with jack wisdom to discover numerical evidence for chaotic motions in the outer planets the digital orrery is now retired at the smithsonian institution in washington dc sussman was also the lead designer of the supercomputer toolkit another multiprocessor computer optimized for evolving systems of ordinary differential equations the supercomputer toolkit was used by sussman and wisdom to confirm and extend the discoveries made with the digital orrery to include the entire planetary system sussman has pioneered the use of computational descriptions to communicate methodological ideas in teaching subjects in electrical circuits and in signals and systems over the past decades sussman and wisdom have developed a subject that uses computational techniques to communicate a deeper understanding of advanced classical mechanics computational algorithms are used to express the methods used in the analysis of dynamical phenomena expressing the methods in a computer language forces them to be unambiguous and computationally effective students are expected to read our programs and to extend them and to write new ones the task of formulating a method as a computer executable program and debugging that program is a powerful exercise in the learning process also once formalized procedurally a mathematical idea becomes a tool that can be used directly to compute results sussman and wisdom have produced a textbook structure and interpretation of classical mechanics and a monograph functional differential geometry to capture these ideas the textbook is now in a second edition sussman has been involved in the engineering of both amateur and professional telescopes he redesigned and rebuilt the mirror support system for the 2 4m hiltner telescope on kitt peak and he helped build and with julie sussman wrote the prototype software for the guider probe controllers for the 6 5m magellan telescopes on las campanas in chile sussman was involved with his former student tom knight in the founding of the field of synthetic biology and he was a teacher in the first class of the igem international genetically engineered machine competition sussman is a life fellow of

a fiber optic camera is inserted into a patient s abdominal cavity to provide a video feed that guides the surgeon through a minimally invasive procedure laparoscopic surgeries can take hours and the video generated by the camera the laparoscope is often recorded those recordings contain a wealth of information that could be useful for training both medical providers and computer systems that would aid with surgery but because reviewing them is so time consuming they mostly sit idle shrinking data for surgical training may 31 17 wearable system helps visually impaired users navigate computer scientists have been working for decades on automatic navigation systems to aid the visually impaired but it s been difficult to come up with anything as reliable and easy to use as the white cane the type of metal tipped cane that visually impaired people frequently use to identify clear walking paths white canes have a few drawbacks however one is that the obstacles they come in contact

padding to protect themselves but this week researchers at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail will present a new method for 3 d printing soft materials that make robots safer and more precise in their movements and that could be used to improve the durability of drones phones shoes helmets and more the team s programmable viscoelastic material pvm technique allows users to program every single part of a 3d printed object to the exact levels of stiffness and elasticity they want depending on the task they need for it 3 d printed robots with shock

swims self destructs a team of csail researchers have developed a printable origami robot that folds itself up from a flat sheet of plastic when heated and measures about a centimeter from front to back weighing only a third of a gram the robot can swim climb an incline traverse rough terrain and carry a load twice its weight other than the self folding plastic sheet the robot s only component is a permanent magnet affixed to its back its motions are controlled by external magnetic fields the entire walking motion is embedded into the mechanics of the robot body says cynthia r sung a csail graduate student and one of the robot s co developers in previous origami robots they had to design electronics and motors to actuate the body itself origami robot self folds crawls climbs swims self destructs manufacturing june 29 10 origami that folds itself csail researchers daniela rus and erik demaine in partnership with harvard university s robert wood have developed a small resin fiberglass sheet programmed to fold itself into three dimensional shapes at this point the object can only take on two shapes but it s a major development in the burgeoning field of computational origami and if you can teach a flat sheet to form itself into a multitude three dimensional shape the applications are endless read more about the research here or check out the video below to watch the sheet in

engineering and computer science mit e mail adamc csail mit edu office 32 g842 contact information publications bibtex cv html pdf update on current status i m on sabbatical through the end of 2018 splitting my time between normal mit activities and developing a startup company based on ur web and upo watch this space for a link to the company web site when one exists my academic pedigree is in the programming languages research community involving such keywords as language design compilers program verification and program derivation i was lucky enough to start using the coq proof assistant shortly before mechanized mathematical proofs started to go mainstream within the programming languages community and since then in a few others most of my work still involves classic programming languages aspects but i ve come to view mechanized proofs as another deserving addition to the list that today includes testing debugging code review and version control that is they will become a standard tool for everyone developing difficult software or hardware systems i think of my research agenda as happening to develop foundational proof assistant tools because most of the rest of the world hasn t realized yet how important they are however today i think of my research interests as covering computer systems broadly construed including all infrastructure at layers that work with discrete rather than continuous values a tongue in cheek way to put it is a digital subset of the layers that are hard to describe to non cs friends at parties in addition to drawing on areas i already mentioned like language design and compilers my current work touches the traditional areas of computer architecture cryptography databases and operating systems where some of the most exciting ideas for me involve making modifications across layers and reconsidering interface boundaries one recurring theme is using mechanized proofs to move isolation enforcement to compile time most of my projects are relevant to security and or privacy and i m also interested in the traditional dimensions of correctness programmer productivity and performance interested in joining my research group at any level undergrad masters phd postdoc already admitted or considering applying please drop me a line to discuss any specific ideas you have for collaboration on projects in programming languages or formal verification i ve also written a summary of the current master plan in the group which may be useful for people considering applying for student or postdoc positions two other low time

proving an indicates a class i co created books certified programming with dependent types a pragmatic introduction to the coq proof assistant an introduction to the coq proof assistant assuming just familiarity with rigorous math and functional programming presents the techniques needed to scale to large formal developments in program verification and other domains including scripted proof automation and expressive types for embedded programs frap formal reasoning about programs introducing coq simultaneously with semantics and program proof methods emphasizes commonalities through casting almost everything in terms of invariants on transition systems with abstraction and modularity as our standard tools for simplifying invariant proofs presents ideas in parallel as chapters of

enough recommended reading i m straying pretty off topic here but especially for all the students who might be reading this far down the page i d like to recommend a few books that have had big influences on me and that i wish i d been told about as a student everything we do in trying to debug problems in the world today depends on understanding how we and other people think and i ve found that evolutionary psychology provides a crucial toolbox for making sense of it all as a general starting point i recommend the moral animal an important subtopic is the roots of the ideological differences that divide us which lately seem to be especially hard to dislodge the righteous mind explains how genes influence moral intuitions and makes a good case for not demonizing people with opposing intuitions and straying even more off topic for a fascinating but north america specific take on regional culture as another source of differences see american nations many of the choices we make have significant environmental consequences and it s important to have a sound scientific basis for evaluating them sustainable energy without the hot air is a good source for the quantitative details the most striking takeaway for me was for my own carbon footprint the total dominance of air travel which is why it s super cool that there is a sigplan climate change committee now to help us get this excessive conference going under control i m in favor of one conference per research area per year with as many parallel tracks as needed one of the consequential kinds of choices we make is about what to eat on the environmental impact side i have to admit i haven t found one book that summarizes the evidence and then makes recommendations without worrying too much about inertia and people s supposed unwillingness to change just food is a start though the standard american diet also has huge problems for promoting good health the best starter source of information there is how not to die our transportation customs in the usa at least also have some remarkably bad but underappreciated consequences personally i support dramatically curtailing use of vehicles that run on roads in favor of much more walking and vehicles that run on rails which are fundamentally more energy efficient as i learned in without the hot air for a fascinating analysis of the implicit subsidy on cars via legal minimum standards on parking spaces see the high cost of free parking there s a lot of hand wringing these days about how hard it is to make it financially starting as a student that may very well be true but for the elite audience likely to read this page with strong skills in computing broadly construed things are pretty rosy the challenge and opportunity is to reconsider norms about how much stuff we really want in our lives and whether it is worth the cost in money health and whatever else see the blog mr money mustache for a firehose of suggestions or the simple path to wealth for a gentler introduction finally relatively on topically anyone out there who is into programming and hasn t yet tried proof assistants should seriously consider grabbing a good introduction like software foundations this technology is going mainstream any year now and in the mean time it s great fun and mental exercise which i d like to think prepares us for solid rational analysis of all sorts of big questions in the world more content and links

their semantics and enable greaterflexibility in their execution this project provides programming language constructs for developing relaxedprograms it also provides proof rules for reasoning about

directly specify and verify relational propertiesthat characterize the desired correctness relationships such as accuracy between the values of variables in a program s original semantics before

waterloo in canada described an algorithm that could determine how to fold a piece of paper into any conceivable 3 d shape it was a milestone paper in the field of computational origami but the algorithm didn t yield very practical folding patterns essentially it took a very long strip of paper and wound it into the desired shape the resulting structures tended to have lots of seams where the strip doubled back on itself so they weren t very sturdy origami anything february 11 13 popular science spotlights erik demaine popular science featured the work of csail principal investigator
