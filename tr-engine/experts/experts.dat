engineering and computer science mit e mail adamc csail mit edu office 32 g842 contact information publications bibtex cv html pdf update on current status i m on sabbatical through the end of 2018 splitting my time between normal mit activities and developing a startup company based on ur web and upo watch this space for a link to the company web site when one exists my academic pedigree is in the programming languages research community involving such keywords as language design compilers program verification and program derivation i was lucky enough to start using the coq proof assistant shortly before mechanized mathematical proofs started to go mainstream within the programming languages community and since then in a few others most of my work still involves classic programming languages aspects but i ve come to view mechanized proofs as another deserving addition to the list that today includes testing debugging code review and version control that is they will become a standard tool for everyone developing difficult software or hardware systems i think of my research agenda as happening to develop foundational proof assistant tools because most of the rest of the world hasn t realized yet how important they are however today i think of my research interests as covering computer systems broadly construed including all infrastructure at layers that work with discrete rather than continuous values a tongue in cheek way to put it is a digital subset of the layers that are hard to describe to non cs friends at parties in addition to drawing on areas i already mentioned like language design and compilers my current work touches the traditional areas of computer architecture cryptography databases and operating systems where some of the most exciting ideas for me involve making modifications across layers and reconsidering interface boundaries one recurring theme is using mechanized proofs to move isolation enforcement to compile time most of my projects are relevant to security and or privacy and i m also interested in the traditional dimensions of correctness programmer productivity and performance interested in joining my research group at any level undergrad masters phd postdoc already admitted or considering applying please drop me a line to discuss any specific ideas you have for collaboration on projects in programming languages or formal verification i ve also written a summary of the current master plan in the group which may be useful for people considering applying for student or postdoc positions two other low time

proving an indicates a class i co created books certified programming with dependent types a pragmatic introduction to the coq proof assistant an introduction to the coq proof assistant assuming just familiarity with rigorous math and functional programming presents the techniques needed to scale to large formal developments in program verification and other domains including scripted proof automation and expressive types for embedded programs frap formal reasoning about programs introducing coq simultaneously with semantics and program proof methods emphasizes commonalities through casting almost everything in terms of invariants on transition systems with abstraction and modularity as our standard tools for simplifying invariant proofs presents ideas in parallel as chapters of

enough recommended reading i m straying pretty off topic here but especially for all the students who might be reading this far down the page i d like to recommend a few books that have had big influences on me and that i wish i d been told about as a student everything we do in trying to debug problems in the world today depends on understanding how we and other people think and i ve found that evolutionary psychology provides a crucial toolbox for making sense of it all as a general starting point i recommend the moral animal an important subtopic is the roots of the ideological differences that divide us which lately seem to be especially hard to dislodge the righteous mind explains how genes influence moral intuitions and makes a good case for not demonizing people with opposing intuitions and straying even more off topic for a fascinating but north america specific take on regional culture as another source of differences see american nations many of the choices we make have significant environmental consequences and it s important to have a sound scientific basis for evaluating them sustainable energy without the hot air is a good source for the quantitative details the most striking takeaway for me was for my own carbon footprint the total dominance of air travel which is why it s super cool that there is a sigplan climate change committee now to help us get this excessive conference going under control i m in favor of one conference per research area per year with as many parallel tracks as needed one of the consequential kinds of choices we make is about what to eat on the environmental impact side i have to admit i haven t found one book that summarizes the evidence and then makes recommendations without worrying too much about inertia and people s supposed unwillingness to change just food is a start though the standard american diet also has huge problems for promoting good health the best starter source of information there is how not to die our transportation customs in the usa at least also have some remarkably bad but underappreciated consequences personally i support dramatically curtailing use of vehicles that run on roads in favor of much more walking and vehicles that run on rails which are fundamentally more energy efficient as i learned in without the hot air for a fascinating analysis of the implicit subsidy on cars via legal minimum standards on parking spaces see the high cost of free parking there s a lot of hand wringing these days about how hard it is to make it financially starting as a student that may very well be true but for the elite audience likely to read this page with strong skills in computing broadly construed things are pretty rosy the challenge and opportunity is to reconsider norms about how much stuff we really want in our lives and whether it is worth the cost in money health and whatever else see the blog mr money mustache for a firehose of suggestions or the simple path to wealth for a gentler introduction finally relatively on topically anyone out there who is into programming and hasn t yet tried proof assistants should seriously consider grabbing a good introduction like software foundations this technology is going mainstream any year now and in the mean time it s great fun and mental exercise which i d like to think prepares us for solid rational analysis of all sorts of big questions in the world more content and links

symposium on discrete algorithms soda 2018 arxiv research highlights slides videos my research focuses on algorithms game theory probability learning and statistics here are some highlights complexity of equilibria my ph d research examines whether rational strategic agents may arrive through their interaction at a state where no single one of them would be better off by changing their own strategy unless others did so as well such a state is called nash equilibrium in honor of john nash who showed that such a state always exists it is commonly used in game theory to predict the outcome arising through the interaction of strategic individuals in situations of conflict with paul goldberg and christos papadimitriou i show that in complex systems nash equilibrium can be computationally unachievable this implies that it is not always justifiable or relevant to study the nash equilibria of a system here is a simplified exposition of our article that we wrote for cacm s february 2009 issue here is also a survey article that i wrote on the complexity of nash equilibria which appeared in a computer science review special volume dedicated to christos papadimitriou s work i more recently showed that even arriving at an approximate nash equilibrium can be computationally intractable my dissertation was awarded the 2008 acm doctoral dissertation award with paul goldberg and christos papadimitriou we also received the game theory and computer science prize from thegame theory society the citation for our paper is as follows this paper made key conceptual and technical contributions in an illustrious line of work on the complexity of computing nash equilibrium it also highlights the necessity of constructing practical algorithms that compute equilibria efficiently on important subclasses of games here is a blog post from the congress by paul in 2011 our same paper was awarded the 2011 siam outstanding paper prize slides and video presentatation on nash equilibrium complexity tutorial on complexity of equilibria video at simons insitute for the theory of computing mechanism design mechanism design sometimes called inverse game theory studies how to design incentives that promote a desired objective in the outcome of the strategic interaction between agents examples include designing an election protocol that ensures the election of the best candidate designing a procedure for allocating public resources in order to maximize the social welfare from the allocation and designing an auction for selling paintings that maximizes the auctioneer s revenue in all these cases the design challenge lies in the fact that the designer s objective is notaligned with that of each strategic agent a voter wants to maximize the chance that her favorite candidate is elected while a bidder wants to maximize his own utility so the right incentives need to be put in place in order to incentivize the agents to behave in a manner that promotes the designer s objective mechanism design has received a lot of study in economics since the 1970s and has found a plethora of applications in practice such as in the design of online markets and the sale of radio spectrum to telecoms by governments but many challenges remain my group has focused on the challenge of multi dimensional mechanism design which targets mechanism design settings in which the preferences of the agents are multi dimensional e g selling multiple items in an auction while maximizing social welfare in this setting can be achieved with thecelebrated vcg mechanism the understanding of other objectives such as revenue optimization is quite limited with yang cai and matt weinberg i provide an algorithmic framework for computing optimal mechanisms for arbitrary objectives as a special application of our framework we provide an algorithmic generalization of myerson s celebrated single item revenue optimal auction to the multi item setting given the auctioneer s information aboutthe bidders in the form of a distribution over their preferences over items and bundles of items our algorithmic framework efficiently computes a revenue optimal auction my work with alan deckelbaum and christos tzamos obtains analytical characterizations of optimal multi item mechanisms in the single buyer setting using optimal transport theory see our econometrica paper

2015 pdf statistics statistics has traditionally focused on the asymptotic analysis of tests as the number of samples tends to infinity moreover typically statistical tests only detect certain types of deviationsfrom the null hypothesis or are designed to select between a null and an alternative hypothesis that are fixed distributions or parametric families of distributions motivated by applications where the sample size is small relative to the support of the distribution which arises naturally in high dimensional settings we re think the foundations of statistics in the small sample regime we also place emphasis on accommodating composite and non parametric hypotheses and aim at detecting all deviations from the null in a nips 15 spotlight paper with acharya and kamath we provide statistical tests for testing non parametric properties of distributions in the non asymptotic regime and with tight control for type ii errors a talk on this work can be viewed here here is also a survey i wrote on non asymptotic statistical hypothesis testing with kamath and wright our more recent work focuses on high dimensional testing problems see bayesnets ising 1 and ising 2 on

requirements foreach value that a function produces and then use rely s static program analysissystem to verify that the function satisfies its specification rely thereforeenables developers to productively exploit the performance benefits of emerginghigh performance architectures while still maintaining control of the program sbehavior papers oopsla 13 slides press slashdot mitnews reasoning about relaxed approximate programs approximate program transformations such as task skipping loop perforation approximate function memoization and approximate data types produce programsthat can execute at a variety of points in an underlying performance versusaccuracy tradeoff space namely these transformed programs trade accuracy oftheir results for increased performance by dynamically and nondeterministicallymodifying variables that control their execution i have defined suchtransformed programs as relaxed programs they have been extended withadditional nondeterminism to relax their semantics and enable greaterflexibility in their execution this project provides programming language constructs for developing relaxedprograms it also provides proof rules for reasoning about acceptabilityproperties which are the key correctness properties of relaxed programs thatenable them to have a range of acceptable executions specifically these proofrules enable programmers to directly specify and verify relational propertiesthat characterize the desired correctness relationships such as accuracy between the values of variables in a program s original semantics before thetransformation and its relaxed semantics moreover these rules enableprogrammers to reuse correctness properties that hold for the original programto efficiently verify the relaxed paper pldi 12

application to monitor its progress specifically bolt records the programstate at the start of each loop iteration if two consecutive loop iterationsproduce the same state bolt reports to the user that the application is in aninfinite loop at the user s option bolt can then transfer control to astatement following the loop thereby allowing the application to escape theinfinite loop and ideally continue its productive execution bolt operates on stripped x86 and x64 binaries dynamically attaches anddetaches to and from the program as needed and dynamically detects loops andcreates program

critical to an application s functionality snap uses block based random fuzz testing to take a seed input and synthesize asuite of alternative inputs that then explore alternative executions of theprogram snap then uses two application oblivious behavioral distancemetrics to identify if the behavior of the program when executedon a generated alternative input substiantially deviates from the behaviorof the program on the seed input these metrics are 1 an executiondistance metric which computes the hamming distance between theset of basic blocks in the trace of each execution and 2 an dynamic tainttracking based influence metric which measures how many bytes of the outputeach byte in the input influences together these two metrics enable snap toidentify critical high data influence

detection and treatment computer system predicts products of chemical reactions machine learning approach could aid the design of industrial processes for drug manufacturing research interests nlp natural language processing i develop machine learning models that aim to understand and generate natural languages we are currently witnessing the first generation of nlp tools that have been deployed at scale and are used by millions of people however the major component of this success is access to large amounts of training data which machines use to learn mappings between input and output in many applications and languages such annotations are not readily available and are expensive and slow to collect i am interested in designing algorithms that do not suffer from this annotation dependence specifically we are developing deep learning models that can transfer annotations across domains and languages that can learn from a few annotated examples by utilizing supplementary data sources and that can take advantage of human provided rationales to constrain model structure oncology learning to cure data collected about millions of cancer patients their pathology slides imaging and other tests contain answers to many open questions in oncology jointly with the mgh collaborators we are developing algorithms that can learn from this data to improve models of disease progression prevent over treatment and narrow down to the cure on the nlp side we are creating databases which record pertinent cancer features extracted from raw documents on the computer vision side we are working on deep learning models that compute personalized assessment from mammogram data focusing on early cancer detection chemistry chemistry ml today drug discovery involves practitioners with years of advanced training and is carried out in a trial and error labor intensive fashion our goal is to change a traditional pipeline in a joint work with chemical

we work in a highly interdisciplinary environment at theinterface of computer science and biology members of the group comefrom a primarily computational background and share a strong passionfor understanding biological systems we are engaged in severalcollaborative research partnerships with biological and experimentalcollaborators at the broad institute the encode modencode gtex andepigenomics roadmap consortia the harvard medical school and otheruniversities kellis lab at mit computer science and broad institute we seek to understand the mechanistic basis of human disease using a combination of computational and experimental techniques this involves developing methods for 1 the systematic discovery and characterization of functional elements in the human genome 2 the discovery and validation of the gene regulatory circuitry controling these elements 3 the use of epigenomic information for annotating regulatory regions and their activity across different cell types and 4 the use of comparative genomics for recognizing coding and non coding regions of functional importance for evolutionary fitness variation and disease translating genetic findings into therapeutics remains an unsolved challenge partly because in 93 of cases disease associated common variants do not disrupt proteins directly but instead alter their genomic control elements our group develops and uses epigenomic maps of regulatory elements and cellular circuits linking them to their regulators and target genes in order to understand how human genetic variation contributes to disease and cancer we have developed resources and methods for studying how genetic variation impacts gene expression regualtory region activity cellular phenotypes and ultimately human disease we have applied these methods to obesity alzheimer s disease cardiovascular traits psychiatric disorders and cancer resulting in multiple insights in addition to dissecting these circuits we have used gene manilations and genome editing to reverse the phenotypic signatures of disease from risk and non risk individuals paving the way for genomics based therapeutics more on variation and disease genome interpretation we have developed comparative genomics methods which can directly discover diverse functional genomic elements based on their characteristic patterns of evolutionary change across related species these evolutionary signatures are dictated by precise functional constraints unique to each class of functional elements thus enabling their genome wide discovery we have used such signatures in the human fly and yeast genomes to recognize protein coding genes and exons rna genes and structures micrornas and their targets and diverse classes of regulatory elements this has resulted in many surprising findings and new insights including extensive stop codon read through in adult brain proteins novel types of rna structures involved in post transcriptional and translational regulation mirna targeting in protein coding regions functionality of both arms of a mirna hairpin and both sense and anti sense mirnas and the discovery of a new class of long intergenic non coding rnas more on genome interpretation protein coding genes non coding rnas gene regulation we have also developed computational methods to study the cellular circuitry of genomes which directs gene expression levels in response to environmental and developmental stimuli our work has resulted in global maps of regulatory elements in yeast and animal genomes and their role in specifying pre and post transcriptional gene regulatory networks combining comparative genomics with experimental datasets we have studied condition specific and tissue specific activation networks and revealed new insights on activation and silencing of developmental genes and post transcriptional targeting by mirna genes read more on chromatin regulatory motifs biological networks epigenomics with the recent availability of genome wide maps of histone modifications we have developed new methods for the systematic discovery of recurrent combinations of chromatin marks or chromatin signatures which we found to be associated with very specific types of functional elements including diverse classes of enhancers promoters and insulators we have used these signatures to discover new elements including novel non coding rna genes and to systematically study the dynamics of chromatin state across tissues and during development and to discover the sequence elements and grammars governing those changes we are currently also exploring the role of small non coding rnas in the establishment maintenance and targeting of chromatin state more on epigenomics regulatory rnas genome evolution we have also developed methods to study systematic differences between the species compared and uncovered important evolutionary mechanisms for the emergence of new functions our work provided definitive proof of an ancestral whole genome duplication in yeast which led to a complete doubling of the gene count and was rapidly followed by massive gene loss asymmetric divergence and new gene functions to further understand the evolutionary processes leading to new functions we developed a phylogenomic framework for studying gene family evolution in the context of complete genomes revealing two largely independent evolutionary forces dictating gene and species specific mutation rates de coupling these two rates also allowed us to develop the first machine learning approach to phylogeny resulting in drastically higher accuracies than any existing phylogenetic method more on evolution phylogenomics we are located on the 5th floor d5 of mit stata center a truly uniquebuilding

kellis genome wide epigenomic maps revealed millions of regions showing signatures of enhancers promoters and other gene regulatory elements however high throughput experimental validation of their function and high resolution dissection of their driver nucleotides remain limited in their scale and length of regions tested here we present a new method hidra high definition reporter assay that overcomes these limitations by combining components of sharpr mpra and starr seq with genome wide selection of accessible regions from atac seq we used hidra to test 7 million dna fragments preferentially selected from accessible chromatin in the gm12878 lymphoblastoid cell line by design accessibility selected fragments were highly overlapping up to 370 per region enabling us to pinpoint driver regulatory nucleotides by exploiting subtle differences in reporter activity between partially overlapping fragments using a new machine learning model sharpr2 our resulting maps include 65 000 regions showing significant enhancer function and enriched for endogenous active histone marks including h3k9ac h3k27ac regulatory sequence motifs and regions bound by immune regulators within them we discover 13 000 high resolution driver elements enriched for regulatory motifs and evolutionarily conserved nucleotides and help predict causal genetic variants underlying disease from genome wide association studies overall hidra provides a general scalable high throughput and high resolution approach for experimental dissection of regulatory regions and driver nucleotides in the

battle brown engelhardt montgomery characterization of the molecular function of the human genome and its variation across individuals is essential for identifying the cellular mechanisms that underlie human genetic traits and diseases the genotype tissue expression gtex project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body many of which are not easily accessible here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues we find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes and we further identify inter chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci on the basis of the identified genetic effects we characterize patterns of tissue specificity compare local and distal effects and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects we also demonstrate that multi tissue multi individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways

computational approach systematic high resolution activation and repression profiling with reporter tiling using mpra sharpr mpra that allows high resolution analysis of thousands of regions simultaneously sharpr mpra combines dense tiling of overlapping mpra constructs with a probabilistic graphical model to recognize functional regulatory nucleotides and to distinguish activating and repressive nucleotides using their inferred contribution to reporter gene expression we used sharpr mpra to test 4 6 million nucleotides spanning 15 000 putative regulatory regions tiled at 5 nucleotide resolution in two human cell types our results recovered known cell type specific regulatory motifs and evolutionarily conserved nucleotides and distinguished known activating and

chan waterhouse fields lin kellis translational stop codon readthrough emerged as a major regulatory mechanism affecting hundreds of genes in animal genomes based on recent comparative genomics and ribosomal profiling evidence but its evolutionary properties remain unknown here we leverage comparative genomic evidence across 21 anopheles mosquitoes to systematically annotate readthrough genes in the malaria vector anopheles gambiae and to provide the first study of abundant readthrough evolution by comparison with 20 drosophila species using improved comparative genomics methods for detecting readthrough we identify evolutionary signatures of conserved functional readthrough of 353 stop codons in the malaria vector anopheles gambiae and of 51 additional drosophila melanogaster stop codons including several cases of double and triple readthrough and of readthrough of two adjacent stop codons we find that most differences between the readthrough repertoires of the two species arose from readthrough gain or loss in existing genes rather than birth of new genes or gene death that readthrough associated rna structures are sometimes gained or lost while readthrough persists that readthrough is more likely to be lost at taa and tag stop codons and that readthrough is under continued purifying evolutionary selection in mosquito based on population genetic evidence we also determine readthrough associated gene properties that predate readthrough and identify differences in the characteristic properties of readthrough genes between clades we estimate more than 600 functional readthrough stop codons in mosquito and 900 in fruit fly provide evidence of readthrough control of peroxisomal targeting and refine the phylogenetic extent of abundant readthrough as

diseases and schizophrenia by jointly harnessing the potential causal enrichments among 848 tissue specific epigenomics annotations from encode roadmap consortium covering 127 cell tissue types and 8 major epigenomic marks riviera identified meaningful tissue specific enrichments for enhancer regions defined by h3k4me1 and h3k27ac for blood t cell specifically in the nine autoimmune diseases and

kellis boyer genetic variants identified by genome wide association studies explain only a modest proportion of heritability suggesting that meaningful associations lie hidden below current thresholds here we integrate information from association studies with epigenomic maps to demonstrate that enhancers significantly overlap known loci associated with the cardiac qt interval and qrs duration we apply functional criteria to identify loci associated with qt interval that do not meet genome wide significance and are missed by existing studies we demonstrate that these sub threshold signals represent novel loci and that epigenomic maps are effective at discriminating true biological signals from noise we experimentally validate the molecular gene regulatory cellular and organismal phenotypes of these sub threshold loci demonstrating that most sub threshold loci have regulatory consequences and that genetic perturbation of nearby genes causes cardiac phenotypes in mouse our work

daly vidal hill bulyk sequencing of exomes and genomes has revealed abundant genetic variation affecting the coding sequences of human transcription factors tfs but the consequences of such variation remain largely unexplored we developed a computational structure based approach to evaluate tf variants for their impact on dna binding activity and used universal protein binding microarrays to assay sequence specific dna binding activity across 41 reference and 117 variant alleles found in individuals of diverse ancestries and families with mendelian diseases we found 77 variants in 28 genes that affect dna binding affinity or specificity and identified thousands of rare alleles likely to alter the dna binding activity of human sequence specific tfs our results suggest that most individuals have unique repertoires of tf dna binding activities which may contribute to phenotypic variation science 351 1450 4 mar 24 2016 144 tissue specific regulatory circuits reveal variable modular

hui hauner kellis genome wide association studies can be used to identify disease relevant genomic regions but interpretation of the data is challenging the fto region harbors the strongest genetic association with obesity yet the mechanistic basis of this association remains elusive we examined epigenomic data allelic activity motif conservation regulator expression and gene coexpression patterns with the aim of dissecting the regulatory circuitry and mechanistic basis of the association between the fto region and obesity we validated our predictions with the use of directed perturbations in samples from patients and from mice and with endogenous crispr cas9 genome editing in samples from patients our data indicate that the fto allele associated with obesity represses mitochondrial thermogenesis in adipocyte precursor cells in a tissue autonomous manner the rs1421085 t to c single nucleotide variant disrupts a conserved motif for the arid5b repressor which leads to derepression of a potent preadipocyte enhancer and a doubling of irx3 and irx5 expression during early adipocyte differentiation this results in a cell autonomous developmental shift from energy dissipating beige brite adipocytes to energy storing white adipocytes with a reduction in mitochondrial thermogenesis by a factor of 5 as well as an increase in lipid storage inhibition of irx3 in adipose tissue in mice reduced body weight and increased energy dissipation without a change in physical activity or appetite knockdown of irx3 or irx5 in primary adipocytes from participants with the risk allele restored thermogenesis increasing it by a factor of 7 and overexpression of these genes had the opposite effect in adipocytes from nonrisk allele carriers repair of the arid5b motif by crispr cas9 editing of rs1421085 in primary adipocytes from a patient with the risk allele restored irx3 and irx5 repression activated browning expression programs and restored thermogenesis increasing it by a factor of 7 our results point to a pathway for adipocyte thermogenesis regulation involving arid5b rs1421085 irx3 and irx5 which when manipulated had pronounced pro obesity and anti

scholar yen kellis epigenomic data sets provide critical information about the dynamic role of chromatin states in gene regulation but a key question of how chromatin state segmentations vary under different conditions across the genome has remained unaddressed here we present chromdiff a group wise chromatin state comparison method that generates an information theoretic representation of epigenomes and corrects for external covariate factors to better isolate relevant chromatin state changes by applying chromdiff to the 127 epigenomes from the roadmap epigenomics and encode projects we provide novel group wise comparative analyses across sex tissue type state and developmental age remarkably we find that distinct sets of epigenomic features are maximally discriminative for different group wise comparisons in each case revealing distinct enriched pathways many of which do not show gene expression differences our methodology should be broadly applicable for epigenomic comparisons and provides a powerful new tool for studying chromatin state differences at the genome scale nature communications 6 7973 aug 18 2015 137 deep learning for regulatory genomics pdf scholar park kellis a fundamental unit of gene regulatory control is the contact between a regulatory protein and its target dna or rna molecule biophysical models that directly predict these interactions are incomplete and confined to specific types of structures but computational analysis of large scale experimental datasets allows regulatory motifs to be identified by their over representation in target sequences in this issue alipanahi et al describe the use of a deep learning strategy to calculate protein nucleic acid interactions from diverse experimental data sets they show that their algorithm called deepbind is broadly applicable and results in increased predictive power compared to traditional single domain methods and they use its predictions to discover regulatory motifs to predict rna editing and alternative splicing and to interpret genetic variants looking beyond regulatory motifs the current results illustrate the power of deep learning for biological data analysis in general the approach can increase predictive power for specific tasks integrate diverse datasets across data types and provide greater generalization given the focus on representation learning and not simply classification accuracy systematic visualization and exploration of internal representations at each layer can yield mechanistic insights and guide new experiments and research directions more broadly deep learning can serve as a guiding principle to organize both hypothesis driven research and exploratory investigation for this potential to be realized statistical and biological tasks must be integrated at all levels including study design experiment planning model building and refinement and data interpretation and to interpret genetic variants nature biotechnology 33 8 825 6 aug 7 2015 134 activity induced dna breaks govern the expression of neuronal early response genes pdf scholar madabhushi gao pfenning pan yamakawa seo rueda phan yamakawa pao stott gjoneska nott cho kellis tsai neuronal activity causes the rapid expression of immediate early genes that are crucial for experience driven changes to synapses learning and memory here using both molecular and genome wide next generation sequencing methods we report that neuronal activity stimulation triggers the formation of dna double strand breaks dsbs in the promoters of a subset of early response genes including fos npas4 and egr1 generation of targeted dna dsbs within fos and npas4 promoters is sufficient to induce their expression even in the absence of an external stimulus activity dependent dsb formation is likely mediated by the type ii topoisomerase topoisomerase iibeta topo iibeta and knockdown of topo iibeta attenuates both dsb formation and early response gene expression following neuronal stimulation our results suggest that dsb formation is a physiological event that rapidly resolves topological constraints to early response gene expression in neurons cell 161 7 1592 605 jun 18 2015

of sequence data for many viruses provides power to detect regions under unusual evolutionary constraint at a high resolution one approach leverages the synonymous substitution rate as a signature to pinpoint genic regions encoding overlapping or embedded functional elements protein coding regions in viral genomes often contain overlapping rna structural elements reading frames regulatory elements micrornas and packaging signals synonymous substitutions in these regions would be selectively disfavored and thus these regions are characterized by excess synonymous constraint codon choice can also modulate transcriptional efficiency translational accuracy and protein folding we developed a phylogenetic codon model based framework fresco designed to find regions of excess synonymous constraint in short deep alignments such as individual viral genes across many sequenced isolates we demonstrated the high specificity of our approach on simulated data and applied our framework to the protein coding regions of approximately 30 distinct species of viruses with diverse genome architectures fresco recovers known multifunctional regions in well characterized viruses such as hepatitis b virus poliovirus and west nile virus often at a single codon resolution and predicts many novel functional elements overlapping viral genes including in lassa and ebola viruses in a number of viruses the synonymously constrained regions that we identified also display conserved stable predicted rna structures including putative novel elements in multiple viral species genome biol 2015 feb 17 16 1 38

experimentally observed imputed signal tracks show overall similarity to observed signals and surpass experimental datasets in consistency recovery of gene annotations and enrichment for disease associated variants we use the imputed data to detect low quality experimental datasets to find genomic sites with unexpected epigenomic signals to define high priority marks for new experiments and to delineate chromatin states in 127 reference epigenomes spanning diverse tissues and cell types our imputed datasets provide the most comprehensive human regulatory region annotation to date and our

studies while the problem of accurate gene tree inference has received considerable attention most existing methods are only applicable to gene families unaffected by horizontal gene transfer as a result the accurate inference of gene trees affected by horizontal gene transfer remains a largely unaddressed problem in this work we introduce a new and highly effective method for gene tree error correction in the presence of horizontal gene transfer our method efficiently models horizontal gene transfers gene duplications and losses and uses a statistical hypothesis testing framework shimodaira hasegawa test to balance sequence likelihood with topological information from a known species tree using a thorough simulation study we show that existing phylogenetic methods yield inaccurate gene trees when applied to horizontally transferred gene families and that our method dramatically improves gene tree accuracy we apply our method to a dataset of 11 cyanobacterial species

these elements are key steps in understanding how cells interpret their genetic blueprint and their environment during development and how that process goes awry in the case of disease one goal of the modencode model organism encyclopedia of dna elements project is to survey a diverse sampling of trfs both dna binding and non dna binding factors to provide a framework for the subsequent study of the mechanisms by which transcriptional regulators target the genome here we provide an updated map of the drosophila melanogaster regulatory genome based on the location of 84 trfs at various stages of development this regulatory map reveals a variety of genomic targeting patterns including factors with strong preferences toward proximal promoter binding factors that target intergenic and intronic dna and factors with distinct chromatin state preferences the data also highlight the stringency of the polycomb regulatory network and show association of the trithorax like trl protein with hotspots of dna binding throughout development furthermore the data identify more than 5800 instances in which trfs target dna regions with demonstrated enhancer activity regions of high trf co occupancy are more likely to be associated with open enhancers used across cell types while lower trf occupancy regions are associated with complex enhancers that are also regulated at the epigenetic

reconstructing the evolutionary histories of gene families and species hosts and parasites and other dependent pairs of entities reconciliation is typically performed using maximum parsimony in which each evolutionary event type is assigned a cost and the objective is to find a reconciliation of minimum total cost it is generally understood that reconciliations are sensitive to event costs but little is understood about the relationship between event costs and solutions moreover choosing appropriate event costs is a notoriously difficult problem we address this problem by giving an efficient algorithm for computing pareto optimal sets of reconciliations thus providing the first systematic method for understanding the relationship between event costs and reconciliations this in turn results in new techniques for computing event support values and for cophylogenetic analyses performing robust statistical tests we provide new software tools and demonstrate their use on a

is enabled by rna s ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds and thus has motivated extensive computational1 2 and experimental3 4 5 6 7 8 efforts for determining rna structures existing approaches for evaluating rna structure have been largely limited to in vitro systems yet the thermodynamic forces which drive rna folding in vitro may not be sufficient to predict stable rna structures in vivo5 indeed the presence of rna binding proteins and atp dependent helicases can influence which structures are present inside cells here we present an approach for globally monitoring rna structure in native conditions in vivo with single nucleotide precision this method is based on in vivo modification with dimethyl sulphate dms which reacts with unpaired adenine and cytosine residues9 followed by deep sequencing to monitor modifications our data from yeast and mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known messenger rna structures and with the high resolution crystal structure of the saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome10 comparison between in vivo and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells there are vastly fewer structured mrna regions in vivo than in vitro even thermostable rna structures are often denatured in cells highlighting the importance of cellular processes in regulating rna structure indeed analysis of mrna structure under atp depleted conditions in yeast shows that energy dependent processes strongly contribute to the predominantly unfolded state of mrnas inside cells our studies broadly enable the functional analysis of

although it has long been appreciated that population related effects such as incomplete lineage sorting ils can dramatically affect the gene tree many of the most popular reconciliation methods consider discordance only due to gene duplication and loss and sometimes horizontal gene transfer methods that do model ils are either highly parameterized or consider a restricted set of histories thus limiting their applicability and accuracy to address these challenges we present a novel algorithm dlcpar for inferring a most parsimonious mp history of a gene family in the presence of duplications losses and ils our algorithm relies on a new reconciliation structure the labeled coalescent tree lct that simultaneously describes coalescent and duplication loss history we show that the lct representation enables an exhaustive and efficient search over the space of reconciliations and for most gene families the least common ancestor lca mapping is an optimal solution for the species mapping between the gene tree and species tree in a mp lct applying our algorithm to a variety of clades including flies fungi and primates as well as to simulated phylogenies we achieve high

powerful approach for inferring evolutionary events like gene duplication horizontal gene transfer and gene loss which are fundamental to our understanding of molecular evolution while duplication loss dl reconciliation leads to a unique maximum parsimony solution duplication transfer loss dtl reconciliation yields a multitude of optimal solutions making it difficult to infer the true evolutionary history of the gene family this problem is further exacerbated by the fact that different event cost assignments yield different sets of optimal reconciliations here we present an effective efficient and scalable method for dealing with these fundamental problems in dtl reconciliation our approach works by sampling the space of optimal reconciliations uniformly at random and aggregating the results we show that even gene trees with only a few dozen genes often have millions of optimal reconciliations and present an algorithm to efficiently sample the space of optimal reconciliations uniformly at random in o mn 2 time per sample where m and n denote the number of genes and species respectively we use these samples to understand how different optimal reconciliations vary in their node mappings and event assignments and to investigate the impact of varying event costs we apply our method to a biological dataset of approximately 4700 gene trees from 100 taxa and observe that 93 of event assignments and 73 of mappings remain consistent across different multiple optima our analysis represents the first systematic investigation of the space of optimal dtl

indirect paths of arbitrary length in a closed form solution by exploiting eigen decomposition and infinite series sums we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in several network applications

elements across multiple human cell types revealing tens of thousands of candidate distal enhancer regions however until recently their experimental dissection by directed regulatory motif disruption has remained unfeasible at the genome scale due to the technological lag in large scale dna synthesis here we employ a massively parallel reporter assay mpra to measure the transcriptional levels induced by 145bp dna segments centered on evolutionarily conserved regulatory motif instances and found in enhancer chromatin states we select five predicted activators hnf1 hnf4 foxa gata nfe2l2 and two predicted repressors gfi1 zfp161 and measure reporter expression in erythroleukemia k562 and liver carcinoma hepg2 cell lines we test 2 104 wild type sequences and an additional 3 314 engineered enhancer variants containing targeted motif disruptions each using 10 barcode tags in two cell lines and 2 replicates the resulting data strongly confirm the enhancer activity and cell type specificity of enhancer chromatin states the ability of 145bp segments to recapitulate both the necessary role of regulatory motifs in enhancer function and the complementary roles of activator and repressor motifs we find statistically robust evidence that 1 scrambling removing or disrupting the predicted activator motifs abolishes enhancer function while silent or motif improving changes maintain enhancer activity 2 evolutionary conservation nucleosome exclusion binding of other factors and strength of the motif match are all associated with wild type enhancer activity 3 scrambling repressor motifs leads to aberrant reporter expression in cell lines where the enhancers are usually not active our results suggest a general strategy for deciphering cis regulatory elements by

the initial sequencing of the genomes from human and other organisms the vast majority of each genome remains unannotated and it is still unclear how to translate genomic information into a functional map of cellular and developmental programs to address this question the drosophila modencode project has undertaken a large scale effort to comprehensively map transcription regulator binding chromatin state replication and nucleosome properties across a developmental time course and in multiple cell lines here we report our initial integrative analysis of the first phase of the project encompassing more than 1000 datasets generated over four years across six production centers our integrated annotation enabled the discovery of new proteincoding non coding rna regulatory replication and chromatin elements that more than triple the annotated portion of the genome we study correlated activity patterns of these elements to infer a functional regulatory network which we use to predict putative functions for new genes reveal stage specific and tissue specific regulators and infer predictive models of gene expression our results provide a reference annotation that can inform directed experimental and computational studies in drosophila and related species and provide a model for systematic data integration towards the comprehensive genomic and functional annotation of any

modifications have been described in the human genome and shown to play diverse roles in gene regulation cellular differentiation and the onset of disease although individual modifications have been linked to the activity levels of various genetic functional elements their combinatorial patterns are still unresolved and their potential for systematic de novo genome annotation remains untapped here we use a multivariate hidden markov model to reveal chromatin states in human t cells based on recurrent and spatially coherent combinations of chromatin marks we define 51 distinct chromatin states including promoter associated transcription associated active intergenic large scale repressed and repeat associated states each chromatin state shows specific enrichments in functional annotations sequence motifs and specific experimentally observed characteristics suggesting distinct biological roles this approach provides a complementary functional annotation of the human genome

genomic tracts are homozygous in three diploid species possibly resulting from recent recombination events surprisingly key components of the mating and meiosis pathways are missing from several

composed of diverse cell types with distinct functions although it is known that lineage specification depends on cell specific gene expression which in turn is driven by promoters enhancers insulators and other cis regulatory dna sequences for each gene the relative roles of these regulatory elements in this process are not clear we have previously developed a chromatin immunoprecipitation based microarray method chip chip to locate promoters enhancers and insulators in the human genome here we use the same approach to identify these elements in multiple cell types and investigate their roles in cell type specific gene expression we observed that the chromatin state at promoters and ctcf binding at insulators is largely invariant across diverse cell types in contrast enhancers are marked with highly cell type specific histone modification patterns strongly correlate to cell type specific gene expression programs on a global scale and are functionally active in a cell type specific manner our results define over 55 000 potential transcriptional enhancers in the human genome significantly expanding the current catalogue of human enhancers and

regev rinn lander there is growing recognition that mammalian cells produce many thousands of large intergenic transcripts however the functional significance of these transcripts has been particularly controversial although there are some well characterized examples most gt 95 show little evidence of evolutionary conservation and have been suggested to represent transcriptional noise here we report a new approach to identifying large non coding rnas using chromatin state maps to discover discrete transcriptional units intervening known protein coding loci our approach identified approximately 1 600 large multi exonic rnas across four mouse cell types in sharp contrast to previous collections these large intervening non coding rnas lincrnas show strong purifying selection in their genomic loci exonic sequences and promoter regions with greater than 95 showing clear evolutionary conservation we also developed a functional genomics approach that assigns putative functions to each lincrna demonstrating a diverse range of roles for lincrnas in processes from embryonic stem cell pluripotency to cell proliferation we obtained independent functional validation for the predictions for over 100 lincrnas using cell based assays in particular we demonstrate that specific lincrnas are transcriptionally regulated by key transcription factors in these processes such as p53 nfkappab sox2 oct4 also known as pou5f1 and nanog together these results define a unique collection of functional lincrnas that are highly conserved and implicated in diverse biological processes

lin deoras rasmussen kellis comparative genomics of multiple related species is a powerful methodology for the discovery of functional genomic elements and its power should increase with the number of species compared here we use 12 drosophila genomes to study the power of comparative genomics metrics to distinguish between protein coding and non coding regions first we study the relative power of different comparative metrics and their relationship to single species metrics we find that even relatively simple multi species metrics robustly outperform advanced single species metrics especially for shorter exons lt or 240 nt which are common in animal genomes moreover the two capture largely independent features of protein coding genes with different sensitivity specificity trade offs such that their combinations lead to even greater discriminatory power in addition we study how discovery power scales with the number and phylogenetic distance of the genomes compared we find that species at a broad range of distances are comparably effective informants for pairwise comparative gene identification but that these are surpassed by multi species comparisons at similar evolutionary divergence in particular while pairwise discovery power plateaued at larger distances and never outperformed the most advanced single species metrics multi species comparisons continued to benefit even from the most distant species with no apparent saturation last we find that genes in functional categories typically considered fast evolving can nonetheless be recovered at very high rates using comparative methods our results have implications for comparative genomics analyses in any species including the human plos comput biol 2008 apr 18 4 4 e1000067 pmcid pmc2291194 pmid 18421375

celniker gelbart kellis the availability of sequenced genomes from 12 drosophila species has enabled the use of comparative genomics for the systematic discovery of functional elements conserved within this genus we have developed quantitative metrics for the evolutionary signatures specific to protein coding regions and applied them genome wide resulting in 1193 candidate new protein coding exons in the d melanogaster genome we have reviewed these predictions by manual curation and validated a subset by directed cdna screening and sequencing revealing both new genes and new alternative splice forms of known genes we also used these evolutionary signatures to evaluate existing gene annotations resulting in the validation of 87 of genes lacking descriptive names and identifying 414 poorly conserved genes that are likely to be spurious predictions noncoding or species specific genes furthermore our methods suggest a variety of refinements to hundreds of existing gene models such as modifications to translation start codons and exon splice boundaries finally we performed directed genome wide searches for unusual protein coding structures discovering 149 possible examples of stop codon readthrough 125 new candidate orfs of polycistronic mrnas and several candidate translational frameshifts these results affect gt 10 of annotated fly genes and demonstrate the power of

duplication followed by massive gene loss and specialization has long been postulated as a powerful mechanism of evolutionary innovation recently it has become possible to test this notion by searching complete genome sequence for signs of ancient duplication here we show that the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae arose from ancient whole genome duplication by sequencing and analysing kluyveromyces waltii a related yeast species that diverged before the duplication the two genomes are related by a 1 2 mapping with each region of k waltii corresponding to two regions of s cerevisiae as expected for whole genome duplication this resolves the long standing controversy on the ancestry of the yeast genome and makes it possible to study the fate of duplicated genes directly strikingly 95 of cases of accelerated evolution involve only one member of a gene pair providing strong support for a specific model of evolution and allowing us to distinguish ancestral and derived functions

encoded in a genome is one of the principal challenges in modern biology comparative genomics should offer a powerful general approach here we present a comparative analysis of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae based on high quality draft sequences of three related species s paradoxus s mikatae and s bayanus we first aligned the genomes and characterized their evolution defining the regions and mechanisms of change we then developed methods for direct identification of genes and regulatory motifs the gene analysis yielded a major revision to the yeast gene catalogue affecting approximately 15 of all genes and reducing the total count by about 500 genes the motif analysis automatically identified 72 genome wide elements including most known regulatory motifs and numerous new motifs we inferred a putative function for most of these motifs and provided insights into their combinatorial interactions the results have implications for genome analysis of diverse organisms including the

surfaces from unorganized sample points in 3d the algorithm is the first for this problem with provable guarantees given a good sample from a smooth surface the output is guaranteed to be topologically correct and convergent to the original surface as the sampling density increases the definition of a good sample is itself interesting the required sampling density varies locally rigorously capturing the intuitive notion that featureless areas can be reconstructed from fewer samples the output mesh interpolates rather than approximates the input points our algorithm is based on the three dimensional voronoi diagram given a good program for this fundamental subroutine the algorithm is quite easy to implement acm siggraph v 32 p 415 421 jul 19 1998 group leader manolis

analysis of biological systems our research is focused on the analysis of complex biological systemsat both the molecular level and the systems level our molecular workconcentrates on the structure and properties of proteins nucleicacids and their complexes investigations probe the sources ofstability and specificity that drive folding and binding events ofmacromolecules studies are aimed at dissecting the interactionsresponsible for the specific structure of folded proteins and thebinding geometry of molecular complexes the roles played by saltbridges hydrogen bonds side chain packing rotameric states solvation and the hydrophobic effect in native biomolecules are beingexplored and strategies for re casting these roles throughstructure based molecular design are being developed our work at the systems level involves the construction and analysisof correlated patterns of gene expression and their relation tobiochemical regulatory networks and signal transduction pathways incells much of this work is motivated by the enormous advances ingenome science and in the availability of parallel arrays of geneexpression data the methods of theoretical and computationalbiophysics and approaches from artificial intelligence appliedmathematics and chemical engineering play key roles in our work

ron weiss associate professor department of biological engineering department of electrical engineering and computer science ph d 2001 massachusetts institute of technology my research focuses on programming new cellular behaviors by designing and embedding synthetic gene networks that perform desired functions in single cells and multi cellular environments we genetically engineer a variety of cell types including bacteria yeast and mammalian stem cells this nascent field of synthetic biology holds promise for a wide range of applications such as programmed tissue engineering environmental biosensing and effecting biomaterial fabrication and an improved understanding of naturally occuring biological processes the construction of de novo genetic circuits begins with the assembly and characterization of genetic parts or building blocks we have assembled a library of genetic components that regulate transcription translation phosphorylation and synthesis of and response to signaling molecules such as acyl homoserine lactones in bacteria and cytokinins in eukaryotes we then combine these parts into various network topologies that elicit new behaviors in a programmable fashion in single cells we have constructed transcriptional cascades and other network topologies with feedback and feed forward motifs we have shown theoretically and experimentally that these networks can perform digital computation attenuate gene expression noise or exhibit analog programmed functions such as pulse generation through the construction and analysis of such fundamental network motifs we aim to demonstrate sophisticated programmed control over gene expression as well as improve our quantitative understanding of naturally occurring complex gene networks another major emphasis is engineering synthetic multicellular systems through the integration of intracellular circuits with cell cell communication mechanisms e g lux and rhl quorum sensing systems beginning with simple sender receiver systems we have built a variety of more sophisticated multicellular interactions for coordinated cell behaviors one such system is the pulse generator where sender cells communicate to nearby receiver cells which then respond with a transient burst of gene expression whose amplitude and duration depends on the distance from the senders in another system receiver cells have been engineered to respond to cell cell communication signals from senders but only if the signal concentrations fall within prespecified ranges we demonstrated experimentally how a multicellular system that consists of several different detection thresholds can generate a variety of interesting spatial patterns shown in the figures below in a third system cells have been engineered to play conway s game of life where cells live or die based on the density of their neighbors this system exhibits complex global emergent behavior that arises from the interaction of cells based on simple local rules we are currently building a variety of other multicellular systems in bacteria that have interesting spatiotemporal dynamics finally we are also implementing synthetic gene networks and artificial cell cell communication in mammalian stem cells in order to control the spatiotemporal expression patterns of cell fate regulators with novel applications in programmed tissue engineering click here for a my lab s webpage click here for a list of my recentcontributions in synthetic biology click here for an older list of my publications my official biological engineering web page is here and myelectrical engineering and computer science web page is here contact info ne47 223 massachusetts institute of technology cambridge ma 02139 rweiss mit edu tel 617 253 8966

machines and a lot of latency how do we build platforms that take graphics applications from oneuser on a single gpu to 10 000 machines and one million users in thecloud even though computer graphics has always been at the vanguardof parallel computing there has been little success using moderncloud based computing resources to improve interactive experiences inthis project we asked the question how could we leverage the massivestorage and batch processing capabilities of the cloud to generate newforms of interactive worlds and we took a precompute everything approach to doing so since one cannot precompute everything aboutan complex interactive world the challenge is to determine what is most important to precompute so these parts can be presentedto the user with the highest quality graphics we find that byrecording statistics of users playing a game we can build a model ofuser behavior and then concentrate large scale cloud basedprecomputation of graphics and physics around the states that usersare most likely to encounter the result is a self refining game whose dynamics improve with play ultimatelyproviding realistically rendered rich fluid dynamics in real time ona mobile

have the compute horsepower to render scenes containing cinematic quality surfaces in real time unfortunately if they render these subpixel polygons micropolygons using the same techniques as they do for large triangles today gpus will perform extremely inefficiently instead of trying to parallelize pixar s reyes micropolygon rendering system we re taking a hard look at how the existing direct3d 11 rendering pipeline and gpu hardware implementations must evolve to render micropolygon workloads efficiently in a high throughput system changes to software interfaces algorithms and hw design are fair game slides describing what we ve learned can be found in this siggraph course talk or in my dissertation evolving the real time graphics pipeline for micropolygon rendering gramps a framework for heterogeneous parallel programming there are two ways to think about gramps graphics folks should think of gramps as a system for building custom graphics pipelines we simply gave up on adding more and more configurable knobs to existing pipelines like opengl direct3d and instead allow the programmer to programmatically define a custom pipeline with an arbitrary number of stages connected by queues to non graphics folks gramps is a stream programming system that embraces heterogeneity in underlying architecture and anticipates streaming workloads that exhibit both regular and irregular dynamic behavior the gramps runtime dynamically schedules gramps programs onto architectures containing a mixture of compute optimized cores generic cpu cores and fixed function processing units the sequoiaprogramming language programming the memory hierarchy sequoia is a hierarchical stream programming language that arose from the observation that expressing locality not parallelism is the most important responsibility of parallel application programmers in scientific numerical domains sequoia presents a parallel machine as an abstract hierarchy of memories and gives the programmer explicit control over data locality and communication through this hierarchy using first class language constructs basically sequoia supports nested kernels and streams of streams sequoia programs have run on a variety of exposed communication architectures such as clusters the cell processor gpus and even supercomputing clusters at los alamos the best way to learn about sequoia is to read our sc06 paper

i can tsay the same for the writing if a static checking person was going toread just one of our papers this should be it i ve used its ideas inevery static checker i ve built since writing it typically morethan once i ve never seen a checker that could not be improved byusing its trick of belief analysis to infer what to check or what thestate of a checked system is based onwhat

incorrect misinformed or all too often merely intended to silence the authors and their ideas personally i have always been amazed that academics who devote their lives to producing new information actually work to censure and diminish the work produced by others and often take pride in doing just that as time goes on one learns to distinguish between those in academia who love the work and those that have instead turned academiainto some sort of career aggressively optimizing their stature at the expense of the community as a whole for young researchers this can be quite daunting but i strongly encourage you to stick to your ideas and goals and the pursuit of what interests you remember the content of your paper and the value of its ideas are not diminished because it was rejected from your preferred venue the content of the paper itself does not change because of the name of the journal printed on the upper corner of the page to emphasize this i decided to list my 3 most cited

mioplanet research the genesis group to better understand our intelligence in general and our keystone story understanding competence in particular my students and i formed the genesis group you can find detailed descriptions of what we do at the genesis page and learn more about why we do it in moonshot below genesis plays the globe yes genesis is playing in the globe today the boston globe that is not the london theater 3 june 2018 moon shot copernicus taught us about the solar system darwin did the same for evolution then watson and crick determined the structure of dna collectively they answered fundamental questions about who we are now we can realistically dream of another scientific achievement of equal importance constructing a top to bottom computational account of our own intelligence my students and i want to do it now because we are curious because the problems are hard because the problems are exciting and because we need a better understanding of ourselves and each other and the forces that make us what we are we need to do it now because the scientific answers will revolutionize the engineering of intelligent systems applications with humanlike intelligence will emerge and empower in education health care policy development business energy the environment cybersecurity and all the other high impact areas with unsolvable problems that we must solve we can to do it now because we are asking better questions because computer power is now effectively unlimited because of encouraging progress in the contributing fields because of maturing techniques for studying the neural substrate and because there is immense student interest our better questions include how are we different from other species and what are the competences we share with other species such that the difference matters our answer is that we do in fact have a differentiating keystone competence we build complex highly nested symbolic descriptions of situations and events together with the competences we share with other species the keystone competence enables story telling story understanding and story composition and all that enables much perhaps most perhaps all of education we may be wasting our time of course but the potential reward is that 1 000 years from now everyone could say that we first understood our own intelligence will they take over links to wcvb

intelligence laboratory members of the genesis group particpate in mit s center for brains minds and machines sponsored by the national science foundation the center is dedicated to developing a deep understanding of intelligence and the ability to engineer it ephasizing how it works how it develops in childhood how it is implemented in neurobiology and how it is amplified through social interaction the center for brains minds and machines emerged from i 2 mit s intelligence initiative a campus wide effort initiated by marc kastner dean of mit s school of science aimed at developing a broad scientific understanding of the brain and human intelligence copyright 2018 patrick henry winston this site was updated on 8 december 2018 designer chiai takahashi teaching in the fall i teach 6 034 introduction to artificial intelligence a large class grades are calculated in accord with several student oriented principles for example because we want to encourage each student to compete with himself herself and not with each other we no longer compute a class average because anyone can have a bad day each segment of the material is tested both in a quiz and on the final and we only count the higher grade we who teach the subject are pleased to note that grades are correlated with attendance at lectures quiz reviews recitations and tutorials anticipating a shift of skill building to the on line world we have enriched the subject with what we call right now talks aimed at exposing exciting up to the minute research occuring at mit in the spring i teach 6 xxx also known as 6 803 and 6 833 the human intelligence enterprise a class in which i focus on contributions that visionary thinkers have made toward developing a computational explanation of intelligence during the independent activities period i talk on the subject of how to speak the talk helps people do a better job in lectures theses defenses and job talks the next offering will be at 11 00 am on friday 1 february 2019 in room 10 250 the center of the universe awards all of us involved in developing and teaching 6 034 and 6 xxx over the years are immensely pleased that our work on these subjects has been appreciated by students our collective efforts led to the 2011 eta kappa nu teaching award for excellence in instruction a macvicar faculty fellowship in 2011 the baker award for undergraduate teaching in 2010 and the graduate student council teaching award in 2006 unknown but heroic students went to a lot of trouble to make it happen we were also pleased to note that according to a bloomberg article 6 034 is among five of the best computer science classes in the u s of course what they meant to say was that 6 034 has had graduate student teaching assistants that are consistently outstanding jessica noss for example was the 2016 winner of the eecs carlton e tucker award for outstanding teaching as a graduate student teaching assistant books during my book writing phase i wrote numerous editions of various textbooks and collections 17 in all free online editions of on to java on to smalltalk on to c and on to c are available via the website video various people have recommended my lectures on neural nets and deep neural nets maybe that is why 6 034 is among the 10 most visited subjects of the 2340 mit subjects with materials offered free to all via mit s opencourseware in the fall i hope to record for ocw a new lecture on deep net enabled alphago i ll also hope to record a second lecture on support vector machines featuring the latest ideas of vladimir vapnik and rauf izmailov pensées transformational news mit s new schwarzman college of computing during the past several years there has been a growing feeling here at mit that we need to address new opportunities emerging from computing research after much consultation with the faculty the administration decided to create the schwarzman college of computing the new college is a very big deal it has been more than half a century since we have created anything at that level it is visionary enabling and exciting it could have been called a school of computing joining mit s schools of engineering science architecture humanities and business in many ways the new college is like a school but i am glad it will be called a college at mit schools by tradition tend to be inward looking with a new label structural experiments will be much easier the leadership of the college of computing can think about how to serve all of mit not just the college of computing itself with a different kind of mission the college will take everything at mit to another level some parts of mit will benefit from ai others will benefit from data science computational modeling new kinds of hardware and software and systems with embedded computing as with anything new there are many ways to get it wrong no one knows what all the right answers are now and those right answers may be wrong answers in a year or two there are challenges and risks the leadership of the new college will have to make difficult decisions and manage through pernicious uncertainties but this is mit we like world changing missions in his inaugural address president reif said that our purpose is to solve the unsolvable shape the future and serve the nation and the world the college of computing can be a great enabler for all of that everyone is talking about analogs to going to the moon so it is a great time to be at mit i am lucky to be here at this big moment of course i am pleased that president reif s announcement featured ai which inspired me to start thinking of where my own work could go with close collaborations with students staff and faculty in all five of our existing schools i focus on what makes our human intelligence unique which could lead to applied systems that think in the same ways we do with success and close collaboration we can create systems for architects that participate in design systems for engineers that give machines a kind of self awareness systems for business strategists that are as useful to them as spreadsheets are to financial analysts and systems for scientists that can suggest analogies like the elevator analogy einstein thought about when developing relativity perhaps more importantly for humanists we can contribute to a better understanding of how we humans think noble and not so noble thoughts in the short term the benefits will come from research in machine learning especially applications of deep learning in the long term i have a very romantic dream of discoveries on par with those of copernicus who showed where we are in the universe with those of darwin who showed where we are in evolution and with those of watson and crick who explained our biology mit will be where we uncover the secrets of our own intelligence how it evolved how it emerges in childhood and how it continues to develop throughout life 20 october 2018 most recent pensées the general patton diet favorite pensées the arcosanti file great works the mit 100 the infinite connection advisor the end of live lectures subscribe to pensées the faculty news letter i am on the board of the mit faculty news letter the voice of the mit faculty in that capacity i have contributed substantially to several editorials including two on mitx mit s on line initiative mitx discusses pros and cons of going on line what s next with mitx comments on possible futures and suggests questions that should be asked i also contributed substantially to an editorial on the abelson report not blameless but not to blame comments on lessons to be learned from professor hal abelson s committee s report to the president mit and the prosecution of aaron swartz i also contributed several teach talk articles skills big ideas and getting grades out of the way explains how we give students two shots at showing they know the material looking at the numbers looks at the correlation between lecture attendance and grades dialog on right now talks describes an experiment aimed at exposing students to what s going on in research right now and finally a phillipic against the idea of a faculty senate where i am my office is room 32 251 in mit s stata center which was designed by frank gehry who i am not i do not use social media for a time there was a fraudulent facebook page with my picture and other material that attempted to deceive now i have a defensive facebook page saying that i do not use facebook or other social media why do imposters do what they do some may be psychotic many are criminals attempting to extract personal information from friends via a form of so called spear phishing who i am you can learn more about who i am and what i m up to from a short biography my curriculum vitae and the rest of this home page several friends and i started ascent technology inc a company that develops products that solve complex resource planning resource scheduling resource allocation and situation assessment problems i served three six year terms as a member of the naval research advisory committee which advises the chief of naval operations and the chief of naval research on technical matters during my second term while i was chair nrac focused on manning and on the concept of an all electric navy one high impact nrac study reduced ship manning led to the smart ship program another cvx flexibility integrated electric power emphasized the need to move toward electric drive on our carriers alas i have learned that nrac along with many other advisory committees did not survive the sequester leaving the navy strangely with no analog of the air force science advisory board or the army science board or the defense science board will i am will likes to see stuff at mit whenever he is in town this time i took him to see robots in the computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory wearable computing in the media lab and miscellaneous cool stuff in the precision engineering research group it wasn t hard to find people to help out continued what mit should do i believe technology will take university education through a period of instability what andy grove would call a 10x period as new educational technology is introduced for the first time since the invention of movable type this period of instability coincides with a window of global scientific opportunity and engineering challenge accordingly i believe that technical universities that want to be important in 2050 should chart a new course now which i lay out somewhat telegraphically in a sample mission statement and in a fanciful interview recorded in 2050

csail mit edu phone 253 5874 room 32 32 g508 g514 gerald jay sussman is the panasonic formerly matsushita professor of electrical engineering at the massachusetts institute of technology he received the s b and the ph d degrees in mathematics from the massachusetts institute of technology in 1968 and 1973 respectively he has been involved in artificial intelligence research at m i t since 1964 his research has centered on understanding the problem solving strategies used by scientists and engineers with the goals of automating parts of the process and formalizing it to provide more effective methods of science and engineering education sussman has also worked in computer languages in computer architecture and in vlsi design sussman is a coauthor with hal abelson and julie sussman of the introductory computer science textbook used at m i t for 23 years the textbook structure and interpretation of computer programs has been translated into french german chinese polish japanese and korean as a result of this and other contributions to computer science education sussman received the acm s karl karlstrom outstanding educator award in 1990 and the amar g bose award for teaching in 1992 sussman s contributions to artificial intelligence include problem solving by debugging almost right plans propagation of constraints applied to electrical circuit analysis and synthesis dependency based explanation and dependency based backtracking and various language structures for expressing problem solving strategies sussman and his former student guy l steele jr invented the scheme programming language in 1975 sussman saw that artificial intelligence ideas can be applied to computer aided design sussman developed with his graduate students sophisticated computer aided design tools for vlsi steele made the first scheme chips in 1978 these ideas and the ai based cad technology to support them were further developed in the scheme chips of 1979 and 1981 the technique and experience developed was then used to design other special purpose computers sussman was the principal designer of the digital orrery a machine designed to do high precision integrations for orbital mechanics experiments the orrery was designed and built by a few people in a few months using ai based simulation and compilation tools using the digital orrery sussman worked with jack wisdom to discover numerical evidence for chaotic motions in the outer planets the digital orrery is now retired at the smithsonian institution in washington dc sussman was also the lead designer of the supercomputer toolkit another multiprocessor computer optimized for evolving systems of ordinary differential equations the supercomputer toolkit was used by sussman and wisdom to confirm and extend the discoveries made with the digital orrery to include the entire planetary system sussman has pioneered the use of computational descriptions to communicate methodological ideas in teaching subjects in electrical circuits and in signals and systems over the past decades sussman and wisdom have developed a subject that uses computational techniques to communicate a deeper understanding of advanced classical mechanics computational algorithms are used to express the methods used in the analysis of dynamical phenomena expressing the methods in a computer language forces them to be unambiguous and computationally effective students are expected to read our programs and to extend them and to write new ones the task of formulating a method as a computer executable program and debugging that program is a powerful exercise in the learning process also once formalized procedurally a mathematical idea becomes a tool that can be used directly to compute results sussman and wisdom have produced a textbook structure and interpretation of classical mechanics and a monograph functional differential geometry to capture these ideas the textbook is now in a second edition sussman has been involved in the engineering of both amateur and professional telescopes he redesigned and rebuilt the mirror support system for the 2 4m hiltner telescope on kitt peak and he helped build and with julie sussman wrote the prototype software for the guider probe controllers for the 6 5m magellan telescopes on las campanas in chile sussman was involved with his former student tom knight in the founding of the field of synthetic biology and he was a teacher in the first class of the igem international genetically engineered machine competition sussman is a life fellow of

disparities in end of life care when discussing racial disparities in medical treatments critics often cite social factors as confounders which explain away any differences comparing the health of whites to that of non whites we do see that environmental and social factors conspire to yield higher rates of disease and shorter life spans in non white populations but does that really show that medical treatment itself is free from bias we examine end of life care in the icu stratified by ethnicity and controlled for acuity using severity assessment scores our analysis agrees with previous studies that nonwhites tend to receive more aggressive high risk high reward treatments such as mechanical ventilation than non whites despite receiving comparable or moderately less noninvasive treatments going further we show that using treatment patterns and clinical notes we are able to infer a patient s race finally we show evidence suggesting nonwhite have a much greater distrust of the medical community among than whites do we find that race even in the great equalizer of end of life care does continue to influence the treatments administered to a patient william boag peter

epigenomics project dr kundaje is a recipient of the 2016 nih director s new innovator award and the 2014 alfred sloan foundation fellowship what we do my primary research interests are computational biology and applied machine learning with a focus on gene regulation our research focusses on development of statistical and machine learning methods for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic and genetic data to learn models of gene regulation we have led the analysis efforts of the encyclopedia of dna elements encode and the roadmap epigenomics projects with the development of novel methods for denoising and normalization of large scale functional genomic data dissecting combinatorial transcription factor co occupancy within and across cell types predicting cell type specific enhancers from chromatin state profiles modeling 3d genome architecture and predicting cell type specific enhancer promoter interactions learning transcriptional regulatory networks that integrate proximal and distal cis and trans signals improving the detection and interpretation of potentially causal disease associated variants from genome wide association studies more recently we have also been developing interpretable deep learning frameworks for functional genomics and epigenomics causal regulatory models by integrating functional genomic data from temporal e g differentiation reprogramming and perturbation e g drug response knockdown genome editing experiments early cancer detection and tissue of origin deconvolution from liquid biopsy e g cell free dna assays methods to understand the relationships between genetic variation regulatory chromatin variation and expression variation in healthy and diseased individuals for more details see our projects

representations see iclr 2013 the 2013 edition was a really good workshop scale event since then it s been growing in size exponentially in 2013 i helped organize the first cvsc workshop it was a reallylively workshop i also helped organize a second workshop on continuous vector space models and their compositionality at eacl 2014 i helped organize a workshop oninteractive language learning visualization and interfaces to be held at acl 2014 trying tobuild an interdisciplinary community interested in the intersection ofnlp hci and data visualization students i made a page listing all my ph d graduates you can find all my students on the stanford nlp group people page research projects the general area of my research is robust but linguistically sophisticatednatural language understanding and opportunities to use itin real world domains particular current topics include deep learning for nlp universal dependencies and dependency parsing language learning through interaction andreading comprehension my research at stanford is currently supported by the nsf darpa bloomberg tencent and ford nsf for gib ntt nhk and theaustralian reseach council i am interested in new students at or accepted to stanford wanting to work in the area of natural language processing to find out more about what i do it sbest to look at my papers or my group research page unadmitted

manning and richard socher if you don t have much background in ai ml or nlp you should start with the first course if you re ready to dive into the latest in deep learning for nlp you should do the second the second course assumes more mathematics prerequisites multivariate calc linear algebra in fall 2016 i will teach for the first time ever linguistics278 programming for linguists and any other digital humanities ortext oriented social science students who think it might be a goodmatch i m trying to learn a little more python beforehand i co taught tutorials on deep learning for nlp at acl 2012 with yoshua bengio and richard socher and atnaacl 2013 with richard socher slides references and videos areavailable in 2012 i co taught a free online course on natural languageprocessing on coursera with dan jurafsky we haven t found the time to revise it and teach a secodn version butyou can watch all the videos by selecting preview lectures andall the slides are available here in june

great mass of data buried in text tables figures and images which lacks structure and so is essentially unprocessable by existing data systems deepdive s most popular use case is to transform the dark data of web pages pdfs and other databases into rich sql style databases in turn these databases can be used to support both sql style and predictive analytics recently some deepdive based applications have exceeded the quality of human volunteer annotators in both precision and recall for complex scientific articles data produced by deepdive is used by several law enforcement agencies and ngos to fight human trafficking the technical core of deepdive is an engine that combines extraction integration and prediction into a single engine with probabilistic inference as its core operation a one pager with key design highlights is here paleodeepdive is featured in the july 2015 issue of nature deepdive is our attempt to understand a new type of databasesystem our new approach can be summarized as follows the data the output of various tools the input from users includingthe program the developer writes are observations from whichthe system statistically infers the answer this view is aradical departure from traditional data processing systems whichassume that the data is one hundred percent correct a key problem indeepdive is that the system needs to consider many possibleinterpretations for each data item in turn we need to explore a hugenumber of combinations during probabilistic inference which is one ofthe core technical challenges our goal is to acquire more sources of data for deepdive to understand more deeply to change the way that science and industry operate 2 fundamentals of data processing almost all data processing systems have their intellectual roots in first order logic the most computationally expensive and most interesting operation in such systems is the relational join recently i helped discover the first join algorithm with optimal worst case running time this result uses a novel connection between logic combinatorics and geometry we are using this connection to develop new attacks on classical problems in listing patterns in graphs and in statistical inference two threads have emerged the first theme is that these new worst case optimal algorithms are fundamentally different from the algorithms used in most of today s data processing systems although our algorithm is optimal in theworst case commercial relational database engines have been tuned towork well on real data sets by smart people for about fourdecades and so a difficult question is how does one translatethese insights into real data processing systems the second theme is that we may need new techniques to get theoretical results strong enough to guide practice as a result i ve started thinking about beyond worst case analysis and things like conditioning for combinatorial problems to hopefully build theory that can inform practice to a greater extent the first papers have just been posted demos examples and papers worst case optimal joins we have posted a survey for sigmod record about recent advances in join algorithms our goal is to give a high level view of the results for practitioners and applied researchers we also managed to simplify the arguments a full version of our join algorithm with worst case optimal running time is here the logicblox guys have their own commercial worst case optimal algorithm our new system emptyheaded is based on this theory beyond worst case joins this work is our attempt to go beyond worst case analysis for join algorithms we with dung nguyen develop a new algorithm that we call minesweeper based on these ideas the main theoretical idea is to formalize the amount of work any algorithm spends certifying using a set of propositional statements that the output set is complete and not say a proper subset we call this set of propositions the certificate we manage to establish a dichotomy theorem for this stronger notion of complexity if a query is what ron fagin calls beta acyclic then minesweeper runs in time linear in the certificate if a query is beta cyclic than on some instance any algorithm takes time that is super linear in the certificate the results get sharper and more fun almost to one algorithm to rule them all we have a much better description of beyond worst case optimality with a resolution framework and a host of new results for different indexing strategies this paper supercedes many of the results in minesweeper and in a much nicer way we also hope to connect more of geometry and resolution but we ll see a first part of our attack on conditioning for combinatorial problems is in nips and on arxiv it is not difficult to get me interested in a theory problem ask around the infolab if you don t believe me our goal is to understand the fundamentals of data processing systems our course material from cs145 intro databases is
