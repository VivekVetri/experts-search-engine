{"page": "http://adam.chlipala.net/", "name": "Adam Chlipala", "details": ["<p>My academic pedigree is in the programming-languages research community, involving such keywords as language design, compilers, program verification, and program derivation.  I was lucky enough to start using <a href=\"http://coq.inria.fr/\">the Coq proof assistant</a> shortly before <b>mechanized mathematical proofs</b> started to \"go mainstream\" within the programming-languages community (and, since then, in a few others).  Most of my work still involves classic programming-languages aspects, but I've come to view mechanized proofs as another deserving addition to the list that today includes testing, debugging, code review, and version control.  That is, they will become a standard tool for everyone developing difficult software or hardware systems.  I think of my research agenda as happening to develop foundational proof-assistant tools because most of the rest of the world hasn't realized yet how important they are.</p>", "<p>However, today I think of my research interests as covering <b>computer systems</b> broadly construed, including all infrastructure at layers that work with discrete rather than continuous values.  A tongue-in-cheek way to put it is (a digital subset of) \"the layers that are hard to describe to non-CS friends at parties.\"  In addition to drawing on areas I already mentioned like language design and compilers, my current work touches the traditional areas of <i>computer architecture</i>, <i>cryptography</i>, <i>databases</i>, and <i>operating systems</i> -- where some of the most exciting ideas for me involve making modifications across layers and reconsidering interface boundaries.  One recurring theme is using mechanized proofs to move isolation enforcement to compile time.  Most of my projects are relevant to <i>security and/or privacy</i>, and I'm also interested in the traditional dimensions of correctness, programmer productivity, and performance.</p>", "<p><i>Interested in joining my research group (at any level: undergrad, masters, PhD, postdoc; already admitted or considering applying)?</i>  Please <a href=\"mailto:adamc@csail.mit.edu\">drop me a line</a> to discuss any specific ideas you have for collaboration on projects in programming languages or formal verification!</p>", "<p>I've also written a <a href=\"summary.html\">summary of the current \"master plan\" in the group</a>, which may be useful for people considering applying for student or postdoc positions.

Emphasizes commonalities through casting (almost) everything in terms of invariants on transition systems, with abstraction and modularity as our standard tools for simplifying invariant proofs.  Presents ideas in parallel as chapters of a PDF with standard math notation and in Coq source files, mixing in bits of proof-automation wizardry at the author's whim.  <i>[I've used this book so far in three iterations of a graduate class and plan to fine-tune it through at least one more offering before declaring it beta-quality; but, for intrepid instructors of related classes, it could be worth experimenting with already!]</i></p>", "<p>I'm straying pretty off-topic here, but, especially for all the students who might be reading this far down the page, I'd like to recommend a few books that have had big influences on me and that I wish I'd been told about as a student.</p>"]},
